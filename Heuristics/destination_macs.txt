# MAC addresses listed in this file are ignored when 
# it is the destination MAC address in a packet.
# Some protocols such as the CISCO Discovery Protocol and 
# VLAN Trunking Protocol do not have an Ether Type so cannot be filtered
# based on that.
# These protocols, however, use a broadcast so they can be filtered / ignored
# based on the destination MAC Address
