This is a project for tools that may help Green Teams.  Tools may be either collected from the Internet or internally developed.

The base files (by name) are as follows: <br/>

| file / directory  | Description  |
|-------------------|--------------|
| ciscot7.py        | Decrypt insecure (password 7) Cisco passwords. |
| encrypted.py      | Test randomness primarily aimed at the ESP layer using IP protocol number 50. There is a sample output file sample_encrypted.csv and a test program test_encrypted.py. |
| Find_MAC_IP       | Original program to find MAC and IP files. Deprecated, use the Heuristics project. |
| Heuristics        | Finds known exploits by examinging PCAP files. |
| isakmp            | Identifies devices of interest based on ISAKMP vendor ID. |
| kmeans.py         | Generate an annotated GraphML file from an input JSON file. |
| README.md         | This file. |
| nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf | NIST document related to encrypted.py indicating how to test for randomness. |

The individual tools are listed below.

## Generating a GraphML file using kmeans.py

kmeans.py uses sklearn. Although the sklearn package is the same as scikit-learn package and you are able to install either, it is better to install scikit-learn. If you install sklearn, it will install scikit-learn and when you use `pip list`, it will show sklearn with version 0.0 and scikit-learn with whatever version you installed. Use `pip install scikit-learn` to install the required sklearn dependency. 


kmeans.py supports the following arguments: <br/>

| parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| -h        | Print usage. |
| -f        | Path to input JSON file.. |
| -d        | Directory of the input JSON files. |
| -o        | Filename for the Output file. |
| -c        | Number of kmeans clusters to use. |

TODO: Add a sample input file for kmeans.py.

## Randomness Testing IPSec With encrypted.py

Test randomness primarily aimed at the Encapsulating Security Protocol (ESP) layer using IP number 50. Data in an ESP packet is encrypted and should, therefore, appear random. Mathematically speaking, a statistic test descxribes how closely the distribution of the data (in our case, encrypted data from the ESP layer), matches the distribution predicted under the null hypothesis of the statistical test used.

This program reads a PCAP file and tests the encrypted data of the ESP layer for randomness. Packets without an ESP layer are ignored.Although the primary purpose of encrypted.py is to test a PCAP files for appropriate randomness (in case data has been modified), it can be used to test any data as is demonstrated in test_encrypted.py.

Each of the tests reduces the data to a bit stream of zeros and ones and tests the bit stream for randomness. Even the matrix rank tests transform the data into a series of 32 x 32 matrices of ones and zeros.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published a methodology to test data for randomness The document [nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/legacy/sp/nistspecialpublication800-22r1a.pdf) is included in this directory of the repository. The intended purpose of the paper is to test random number generators to see if they are random. Fifteen separate tests are presented to test a random sequence.

The original code was pulled from git with a write-up by the author [hacking the random walk hypothesis](http://www.turingfinance.com/hacking-the-random-walk-hypothesis/). Pull the code as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/StuartGordonReid/r4nd0m.git

A CSV file is generated with the columns shown in the table below. If the CSV is loaded into a spreadsheet such as Excel or Calc, the first column below (Col) identifies the spreadsheet column numbers (A, B, ... AZ). The second column (#) identifies the numeric index (starting at zero) of the column. The third column (Title) is the column title except in the spread sheet. Note that each individual test result has a number in front of it. The number identifies a test as enumerated in the NIST document. Some tests return variations or have multiple returns values and these are listed as the same test number; for example, number 13 has results for running the Cumulative Sums Test forwards and backwards. The fourth column has a brief description of what the column contains; refer to the NIST document for a more complete description. <br/>

| Col | #  | Title      | Description |
|-----|----|------------|-------------|
|  A  | 0  | Index      | Zero based index to the packet in the pcap file.|
|  B  | 1  | Percent    | Percent Passed |
|  C  | 2  | Num Passed | Number of tests that passed |
|  D  | 3  | Num Skipped | Number of tests skipped because they were considered not appropriate for the test. |
|  E  | 4  | Num Failed | Number of tests that failed the randomness test. |
|  F  | 5  | Confidence Level| Confidence level used for the tests, probably 0.005. |
|  G  | 6  | 01. Monobit Test | Determine if the number of ones and zeros in a sequence are approximately the same as would be expected. All tests depend on this test. The P-value should be â‰¥ 0.01 to accept the value as random.  |
|  H  | 7  | 02. Block Frequency Test | Determine if the number of ones and zeros in each of M non-overlapping blocks created from a sequence appear to have a random distribution.|
|  I  | 8  | 03. Independent Runs Test | A run is a series of increasing (or decreasing) values. This test looks at the number and length of runs; see [Runs Test for Detecting Non-randomness](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda35d.htm) |
|  J  | 9  | 04. Longest Runs Test | See Indep4endent Runts test above. |

|  N  | 13 | 08. Overlapping Patterns Test | Similar to the Non Overlapping Patterns Test, but looks at the number of non-occurrences of patterns. |
|  O  | 14 | 09. Universal Test | Detect if the sequence can be significantly compressed; random data should not be easily compressible. |
|  P  | 15 | 10. Linear Complexity Test | Use an LFSR to Determine if the sequence is complex enough to be considered random. |
|  Q  | 16 | 11. Serial Test (p01) | Look at the frequencey of all possible overlapping m-bit patterns across the sequence. This looks at p-value 1. |
|  R  | 17 | 11. Serial Test (p02) | Look at the frequencey of all possible overlapping m-bit patterns across the sequence. This looks at p-value 2. |
|  S  | 18 | 12. Approximate Entropy Test | Similar to the Serial Test, but compare the frequency of overlapping blocks of two consecutive / adjacent lengths against the expected result for a random sequence. |
|  T  | 19 | 13. Cumulative Sums Test (Forward) | The maximal excursion (from zero) of the random walk moving forward. Result should be near zero. |

A few notes to consider:

- The confidence Level is a value set in the program `self.confidence_level = 0.005` and this is used to determine if a test passes or fails, this is not a confidence level that a particular sample is random.
- A p-value of -1 means that the test was skipped. The program determined that the data was not suitable for the test; for example, perhaps the size is too small.
- A p-value â‰¥ 0.01 is a passing value for a specific test.
- The first test, Monobit or Frequency, is one of the most important tests. To quote from the NIST paper, *All subsequent tests are conditioned on having passed this first basic test.* In other words, if this test fails, the data is probably not random.


### Using encrypted.py

This program uses external Python packages such as scapy, numpy, and scipy. The following arguments are supported: <br/>

| parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| -f | Path to the input PCAP file. This is required.|
| -o | Filename for the output CSV file.|
| -s | Comma delimited list of valid source IP addresses. If an IP address is included, packets that do | not have an approved source IP addresses are skipped / ignored. |
| -d | Comma delimited list of valid destination IP addresses. If an IP address is included, packets that do not have an approved destination IP addresses are skipped / ignored. |
| -v | Specify an integer verbosity level. Default is zero, but values of 1 and 2 are currently supported. |

The default verbosity setting is zero, which only prints summary data. The test below has only 11 encrypted packets, wich demonstrates that running multiple tests for randomness takes a lot of time. If time is of the essence, identify specific tests as the most important, such as the Monobit test and one or two others and run only those tests against the data.

Increasing the verbosity to two causes the payload length to be printed as well as a full dump of the data for every encrypted packet. Interesting, but not normally desired.
